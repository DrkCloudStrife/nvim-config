NeoVim Configuratons
===

When I started using VIM, I was using a fork of someone's VIM configuration.
This configuration uses submodules, and I want to avoid that as it makes it 
harder to maintain. I've also been using a combination of OSX and Ubuntu (*NIX)
operating systems. I'm hoping to be able to combine these neovim configurations
to be easily accessible and shared across both environments.

## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DrkCloudStrife/nvim-config.git ~/.nvim-config
cd ~/.nvim-config
./bootstrap.sh
```
